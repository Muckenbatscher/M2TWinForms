         * L*a*b*. default = 50.0
         * @param surround A general description of the lighting surrounding the color. 0 is pitch dark,
         * like watching a movie in a theater. 1.0 is a dimly light room, like watching TV at home at
         * night. 2.0 means there is no difference between the lighting on the color and around it.
